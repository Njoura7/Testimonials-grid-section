## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-I need to focus on which path should i use depending on css file not scss, because as i learned scss is a perprocessor that can only be compiled through css
-I need to work more on oraganizing my code (using BEM for the a next time)

### Continued development

I need to work more on organizing my code, even though Istarted to get used to saas and how to use the "@import"
I definetly need to give the BEM approche a try

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Youtube is a very hellpful recources for all developers, I mean you just need to tape your bug or where did you have an issue and a ton of tutorials will appear.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is the place where almost all the developers of the word meet, lot of them have experiences and are willing to help but also lot of them are just looking for help, So it's a great community and great resource for sure.
